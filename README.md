# Unlocking Framework Independence with Web Components
Welcome to the repository for the DevConf.IN session on "Unlocking Framework Independence with Web Components." This repository includes the demo code and samples discussed during the session, aimed at helping developers leverage the power of Web Components to create reusable, framework-agnostic UI elements.

## Overview
In modern web development, thereâ€™s a growing demand for flexible, reusable components that can work across different frameworks and technologies. Web Components provide a solution by offering a set of standardized APIs that allow developers to build custom elements that are independent of any specific framework.

This session demonstrates how Web Components can be implemented in real-world scenarios, showing their benefits for interoperability, maintainability, and scalability. Whether you're using Angular, React, Vue, or no framework at all, Web Components can help you create UI elements that work seamlessly across platforms.

## Quick Start
To get started with the code samples, clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:ArathyKumar/dev-conf-in-web-components.git
cd dev-conf-in-web-components
Open the web-component-demo.html file in a browser to see the Web Components in action.
```

### Additional dependencies
